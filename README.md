## Welcome to Week 8!

In this week -- 課題がありません :)  その代わり、自分で考えて、自分で実装していくようなプロジェクトのための時間を作っておきました。

You should go through these phases:

1. Concept [Monday]
2. Technical design [Monday/Tuesday] 
3. Implementation [Monday-Friday]
4. Release / demo [Friday]

## Setup 

Note: DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY!

Instead, clone it down to your laptop, then use it as a template for your own, NEW repository (for example, delete the `.git` directory and do `git init` again--)

Then-- begin filling out the `doc/concept.md` and `doc/tech-design.md` Markdown files!

## Virtual Standup

In software development teams, there is the idea of "standups".　日本的に言えば、スタンドアップは「朝礼」... かな？

So, for week 8, let's do a **virtual standup** for your one-person team!  

In your personal Slack channel, please answer these 3 questions by 10:30am each day this week!

```
The Traditional Three Questions in Standup
1) What have I done since this time yesterday? (bugs fixed / features added / plans made / investigations completed, etc)
2) What will I have done as of this time tomorrow? 
3) What am I currently blocked on (if anything), and how will I unblock myself? 
```


## FAQ 

**Can I make more than one application?  I have a few small ideas I want to try!**

No problem!

**Should this be a public or private repository?**

Public is ok!  Of course if you are doing something SUPER SECRET for the company, then come talk to us!  Let's not get in trouble with Hirako-san!!!

**I already started using a Google Doc, should I convert to Markdown?**

Yes, please!  Thank you for your patience :)  We decided the Github/PR format would be easier to provide feedback--

**I don't have any ideas!  What should I do?**

Come talk to the staff, including Hayashi-san and Tim!!!

**How do I talk to Tim?? Do I DM him? What's his phone number?**

Please talk to Hayashi-san first to get a time-slot.  You can also try calling `03-3213-1111`, and ask for "The Emperor". 

**What technology can I use?  Can I use... Haskell?  Rust?  Something else????**

No, you cannot use Rust etc....  Sorry -- we know those are very cool technologies, too---  

Instead, please use the technologies that we have covered so far in the 研修！

**Do I have to make both a client and a server?  My idea is iOS only...**

It's better to have both a client and a server. If you want to do client-only, please come talk to Hayashi-san! It might be ok!

**If it's both a client and a server, that means there are two repositories, right?**

Right!  You will have at least 2 repositories, one for the client and one for each service. 

Please use the same naming convention that we had in the 課題:

1) `-app`
2) `-service`

**Can we work together in teams???**

No, not for Week 8...  Sorry!  Maybe for the 自主制作期間（11週目以降）可能かもしれませんけど、ケースバイケースです。その時になったらまた相談してください！

**Do I have to write tests?** 

Yes!  Please write some tests, like you saw  in the 課題!

**Does it matter which kind of tests I write?**

Ideally, please try to write both unit tests and integration tests. 

At minimum, write unit tests for some of the core business logic. 

**Can I borrow code from the 課題？**

Absolutely ok!

**Is it ok to help each other?**

Please try to solve problems as best you can on your own, and talking with the staff.  Let's try for「自走力」!

You CAN ask questions to the 研修 community on Slack -- but please ask well-researched questions, i.e., that explain what you have tried so far.
